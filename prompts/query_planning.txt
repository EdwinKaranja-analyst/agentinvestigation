You are analyzing a fraud ticket to decide which data to fetch.

TICKET DATA:
{ticket_data}

YOUR TASK:
Extract identifiers (IMEI, Account Number, Loan ID, Phone) and decide:
1. Should we fetch DFRS data? (only if device supports it and fraud involves device tampering)
2. Should we fetch historical tickets? (usually yes - it's fast)

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON. No explanation, no markdown, no code blocks.

Example output:
{{
  "identifiers": {{
    "imei": "123456789",
    "account_number": "ACC123",
    "loan_id": null,
    "phone": null
  }},
  "fetch_dfrs": true,
  "fetch_history": true,
  "fraud_type": "device_tampering",
  "reasoning": "Device tampering suspected based on ticket description"
}}
