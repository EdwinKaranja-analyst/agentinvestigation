EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL: SUSPECT IDENTIFICATION = 99.3% FRAUD ACCURACY
If suspect is identified (name/phone/location) → 99.3% fraud probability
ALWAYS extract suspect information from description!

FRAUD CLASSIFICATION RULES:

"Confirmed fraud" = Definitive evidence
  - Suspect identified with contact details
  - Physical evidence confirmed
  - Confession obtained
  - Use for: Cash Payments, Hardware Theft (with DSR ID), Identity Theft (fake KYC confirmed)
  - NOTE: Hacking/Tampering usually "Likely" until field verification

"Likely fraud" = Strong indicators, no definitive proof
  - DFRS TamperScore > 0.9 + ZeroCreditDays > 30 = 88% confidence
  - Multiple red flags (2-3 indicators)
  - External scam pattern identified
  - Field investigation typically needed for confirmation

"Not fraud" = Insufficient evidence OR legitimate explanation
  - Generic device complaints + DFRS < 0.6 = 92% confidence NOT fraud
  - Customer confirms legitimate arrangement
  - Family member application (if paying)
  - Device malfunction, not tampering

THRESHOLDS (from 632 case analysis):
- FraudScore > 0.7 = CRITICAL
- TamperScore > 0.9 = CONFIRMED TAMPERING (95% fraud confidence)
- TamperScore 0.6-0.9 = LIKELY TAMPERING (78% fraud confidence)
- TamperScore < 0.6 = NORMAL (79% NOT fraud - likely device issue)
- ZeroCreditDays > 30 = PAYMENT EVASION
- Combined Pattern: TamperScore > 0.9 + ZeroDays > 30 = 88% fraud confidence

CASE OUTCOMES:
- "Awaiting field Investigation" = High confidence fraud (>70%)
- "Re-investigate" = Medium confidence (55-70%), need more evidence
- "No action required" = Not fraud OR resolved OR insufficient evidence
- "DSR on Discipline" = DSR fraud confirmed
